# Case Study Quality Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Total Case Studies:** 56
**Average Quality Score:** 81.7/100

## Executive Summary

After implementing enhanced quality detection (AI slop detection, quantified results, technical depth), the average score dropped from **95.4/100 (completeness)** to **81.7/100 (quality)**.

While all case studies have excellent structure and completeness, **68% contain generic marketing language** ("cutting-edge", "revolutionary") and **89% use weasel words** ("may help", "could improve").

## Key Findings

### 🚨 Critical Issues

1. **Academic References: 0/56** (100% missing)
   - Every case study lacks academic citations
   - Quick fix: Add algorithm foundation papers

2. **AI Slop Epidemic: 38/56** (68%)
   - 60 total occurrences across case studies
   - Most common: "next-generation" (multiple uses), "revolutionary", "cutting-edge"

3. **Weasel Words: 50/56** (89%)
   - 117 total occurrences
   - Shows lack of confidence / specificity
   - Use definitive language instead

4. **Low Technical Depth: 39/56** (70%)
   - Only 17 case studies have 3+ quantum keywords
   - Content is too generic / high-level
   - Needs more technical substance

### ⚠️ Secondary Issues

5. **Missing Quantified Results: 24/56** (43%)
   - Only 32 case studies have specific numbers/percentages
   - Weakens impact and credibility

6. **Resource Links: 19/56** (34% missing)
   - 37 have resource links, 19 don't
   - Easy fix with company blog posts / press releases

## Quality Distribution

| Grade | Score Range | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Excellent | 90-100 | 0 | 0% |
| Good | 80-89 | 43 | 77% |
| Needs Work | 60-79 | 13 | 23% |
| Poor | <60 | 0 | 0% |

**Note:** No case study scores above 90 due to universal lack of academic references (worth 5 points) and widespread quality issues.

## Improvement Priorities

### Phase 1: Universal Fixes (Affects All 56)
**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** High

1. **Add Academic References**
   - Start with algorithm foundation papers
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours for all 56 case studies
   - Would increase average score by ~5 points

2. **Add Resource Links**
   - Find company blog posts, press releases
   - Estimated: 30 mins per case study (9 hours for 19 missing)
   - Would increase average score by ~3 points for affected cases

### Phase 2: AI Slop Removal (Affects 38)
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High

1. **Remove/Replace Generic Phrases**
   - Replace "cutting-edge" → specific technical approach
   - Replace "revolutionary" → specific innovation
   - Replace "next-generation" → technical specifications
   - Estimated: 15 mins per case study (9.5 hours for 38 affected)

2. **Remove Weasel Words**
   - Replace "may help" → "enables"
   - Replace "could improve" → "improves"
   - Replace "potentially" → concrete statements
   - Estimated: 10 mins per case study (8 hours for 50 affected)

### Phase 3: Add Technical Depth (Affects 39)
**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium

1. **Increase Quantum Terminology**
   - Add terms: qubits, quantum gates, entanglement, superposition, etc.
   - Requires understanding of each case study's technical details
   - Estimated: 30 mins per case study (19.5 hours for 39 affected)

### Phase 4: Add Quantified Results (Affects 24)
**Effort:** High | **Impact:** High (for credibility)

1. **Find Specific Numbers**
   - Research press releases / papers for metrics
   - Add percentages, multipliers, cost savings, time improvements
   - Estimated: 30-60 mins per case study (12-24 hours for 24 affected)

## Recommended Workflow

### Week 1: Quick Wins
- Add academic references to all 56 (2 hours)
- Add resource links to 19 missing (9 hours)
- **Result:** Average score → ~85/100

### Week 2-3: Clean Up Top 10
- Remove AI slop from worst 10 offenders (3 hours)
- Remove weasel words (2 hours)
- Add technical depth (5 hours)
- **Result:** Bottom 10 → 80+/100

### Week 4-6: Improve Remaining Cases
- Systematically improve remaining 13 "needs work" cases
- Focus on quantified results research
- Add technical depth where missing

### Ongoing: Quality Gates
- Use enhanced audit before publishing new content
- Block publication if score < 70
- Maintain quality standards going forward

## Tools & Automation

### Immediate
- ✅ Enhanced audit script (done)
- ✅ Quality standards config (done)

### Future (Issue #138)
- Admin UI validator showing quality score in real-time
- Inline warnings for AI slop detection
- Pre-publish quality gates

## Conclusion

While our case studies have excellent **structure and completeness** (56/56 have all required fields), they suffer from **generic language and lack of specificity**.

The good news: These are **editorial issues**, not fundamental content gaps. With focused effort over 2-3 weeks, we can:
- Eliminate AI slop entirely
- Add academic credibility
- Increase technical depth
- Achieve consistent 85-90/100 scores

**Next Action:** Start with Phase 1 (universal fixes) to quickly boost all scores, then systematically improve the bottom 13 case studies.
